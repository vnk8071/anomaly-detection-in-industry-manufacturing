# Anomaly Detection in Industry Manufacturing

## Introduction

Anomalib is a deep learning library that aims to collect state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms for benchmarking on both public and private datasets. Anomalib provides several ready-to-use implementations of anomaly detection algorithms described in the recent literature, as well as a set of tools that facilitate the development and implementation of custom models. The library has a strong focus on image-based anomaly detection, where the goal of the algorithm is to identify anomalous images, or anomalous pixel regions within images in a dataset. Anomalib is constantly updated with new algorithms and training/inference extensions, so keep checking!

## Dataset
THE MVTEC ANOMALY DETECTION DATASET (MVTEC AD)

MVTec AD is a dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection methods with a focus on industrial inspection. It contains over 5000 high-resolution images divided into fifteen different object and texture categories. Each category comprises a set of defect-free training images and a test set of images with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects.

## Install packages
```
conda create -n anomaly-detection python=3.8
conda activate anomaly-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Flow model

## Custom dataset
For each new dataset, the data consist of three folders:
- train, which contains the (defect-free) training images
- test, which contains the test images
- ground_truth, which contains the pixel-precise annotations of anomalous regions
